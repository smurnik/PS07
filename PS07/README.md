## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to
GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and
a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
library(maps)
library(tidycensus)
library(tmaptools)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
